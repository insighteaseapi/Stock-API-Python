It offers a range of functionalities, including fetching stock symbols, retrieving real-time prices, analyzing historical data, and generating financial reportsâ€”all powered by Python.

### Components:
- `insightease_stock.py`: Implements the `insighteaseStock` class, which provides multiple API interaction methods.
- `main.py`: Demonstrates the usage of `insighteaseStock` by calling various functions and printing the results.

# Integration of the Insightease Stock API

## Summary
Insightease's Stock API provides features such as stock price retrieval, accessing the latest market values, fetching stock symbols, and leveraging Python to analyze historical data.

### Elements:
- The `insighteaseStock` class, which offers a number of API interaction methods, is implemented by `insightease_stock.py`.
- `main.py`: Shows how to use `insighteaseStock` by executing different functions and displaying the output.

## Installation

### Necessities
Make sure Python is installed; it is advised to use Python 3.6 or later. Install the necessary dependencies next:

#### Necessary Library
**Requests**: Making HTTP calls to the API and managing their answers are done with this library.

Use the following command to install the dependencies:
```sh
pip install requests
```

## Application
To make API requests and retrieve stock data, run the main script:
```sh
python main.py
```

## Use Case Example
An example request to retrieve the most recent Apple (AAPL) stock price is as follows:
```python
from insightease_stock import insighteaseStock

stock_api = insighteaseStock(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
latest_price = stock_api.get_stock_Latest_price(symbol='AAPL', exchange='NASDAQ')
print("Latest Price of AAPL:", latest_price)
```

## Notes
- In order to manage API calls, the **requests** library is necessary.
- Rather than being hardcoded, the API key ought to be safely stored.
- Verify that the API base URL is accurate and current.
- Since the return format is JSON, processing and parsing must be done correctly.
